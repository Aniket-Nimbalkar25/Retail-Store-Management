# Retail-Store-Management

Retail shops help people to fulfil the daily needs of groceries. Tracking such a huge amount of data related to products, customers, employees, orders, payments, and suppliers is essential for retail shops. Managing all these records on paper is untrustworthy, susceptible and sloppy. The motto of our project is to create a rational database to access, manage, modify, and update data as per the requirement.
